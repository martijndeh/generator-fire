Yeoman Generator for Node on Fire
==============

### Warning: this generator is currently out of date. We've added an option to generate your initial project in the `fire` cli instead. Please have a look at the [Node on Fire](https://github.com/martijndeh/fire) repo. Feel free to create an issue if you prefer to work with Yeoman generator. 

Node on Fire is a full-stack web framework built on top of AngularJS, Express and PostgreSQL. See http://nodeonfire.org/.
